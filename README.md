# Worldwide-Covid-Vaccinations-Data Exploration

The Covid-19 vaccine has changed the course of the pandemic. In total, 162 doses have been given for every 100 people around the world. In countries that reached the highest levels of vaccination, death rates plummeted.

Amid this progress, the world was caught off guard when the omicron variant rose to prominence in late 2021. Omicron proved somewhat less severe than previous variants, but it spread much faster.

Millions of vaccinated people have gotten sick from the omicron strain, but the shots served their most important functionâ€”preventing severe illness. During the omicron wave, vaccination with a booster reduced the chance of hospitalization and death by more than 90%. Sudden spikes of cases from the fast-moving variant have pressured health systems, but the outlook for the average Covid patient has improved significantly.

In this Exploratory Data Analysis project, we look to answer certain questions regarding the Global Vaccination program to combat COVID-19. The important tools used for this project are SQL and Tableau where the results will be visually illustrated.
